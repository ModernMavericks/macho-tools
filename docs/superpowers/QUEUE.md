# Work queue

The agreed order. Each item names its spec and, once written, its plan.

| # | item | spec | plan | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Report what macho9 did | — | `plans/2026-09-10-report-what-macho9-did.md` | **done**, pushed, CI green at `77f076a` |
| 2 | Edit scripts | `specs/2026-09-10-edit-scripts-design.md` | `plans/2026-09-10-edit-scripts.md` | plan written; execution paused for owner review |
| 3 | Rename + target | `specs/2026-09-10-machotool-rename-and-target-design.md` | — | spec written, awaiting review |
| 4 | Release conformance | `specs/2026-09-10-release-conformance-design.md` | — | spec written, awaiting review |
| 5 | Relations + verb lowering | `specs/2026-09-10-relations-and-verb-lowering-design.md` | `plans/2026-09-10-relations-and-verb-lowering.md` | plan written; shelved until item 2 merges |
| 6 | **Human code review + excellent documentation** | — | — | not started |
| 7 | History rewrite | — | — | explicitly last |

## Why this order

**2 before 5.** Relations and verb lowering have nothing to attach to until
`MS_TABLE`, `ms_script` and `me_run` exist.

**3 before 4.** `release.yml`'s artifact list names `macho9`, `macho9-compat.sh`
and `macho9-translate.sh`; the rename changes all three. Landing release
conformance first would edit the same lines twice.

**6 before 7, and 6 after everything else.** A human review wants the code in its
final shape — renamed, versioned, with the language in place — so it is not
reviewing something about to be restructured. And it must come *before* the
history rewrite for two reasons: a review that produces changes puts those
changes in the history being rewritten, and a rewrite done first would mean the
reviewer is reading commits that no longer exist by the time their comments land.

**Documentation belongs with the review, not after it.** Item 6 is one item on
purpose. The docs are part of what gets reviewed — a human reading this codebase
reads the comments and the READMEs as much as the code, and this repo already
treats a comment that claims more than the code does as a defect. Sequencing a
documentation pass *after* the review would mean the reviewer read the version
that was not yet worth reading; sequencing it before would mean polishing prose
about code the review is about to change.

One known input to that pass, raised by the repo owner while approving item 5's
design: **the module prefixes** (`mi_`, `mr_`, `mg_`, `mo_`, `mseg_`, `mswift_`,
`wa_`, `ms_`, `me_`) mean nothing to a reader who has not learned them. That is a
readability decision no single design should make unilaterally, and item 6 is
where it belongs.

**7 last** because rewriting history invalidates every commit SHA this repo's
docs, ledgers and plans cite.

## Outstanding owner actions

- Review the four specs above (items 2–5).
- Decide whether to resume item 2's execution — it is paused at `5bea3ae` with
  nothing of Task 0 landed.
- The three rename steps, when item 3 starts, in this order: the agent's project
  directory, then the clone, then the GitHub repo. The first must come first or
  four memories and every transcript of this work are orphaned.
